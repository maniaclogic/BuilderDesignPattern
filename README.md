# BuilderDesignPattern
Simple example of the Builder design pattern in java.

The src/ directory contains the Java Classes [Chair and ChairBuilder] used for this example.
An implementation example can be found in main. 
The current output is:

>> Chair{name='null', colour='black', numOfLegs=0, rollChair=true, leansBack=false}


The code is kept extremely simple to keep the focus on the Design Pattern usage.
